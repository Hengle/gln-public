Here is a rough outline of my career, which is taken from one of my presentaions in 2015 (in Chinese):

------------------

A pretty long text-version:

I'm Gu Lu(顾路), a game developer moved to Guangdong Zhuhai(广东珠海) in 2014 (previously living in Shanghai for 9 years). 

After graduated from Wuhan University of Technology(武汉理工大学), I came to Shanghai in 2005 and worked at **Ubisoft (Shanghai)** for two titles - Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter(幽灵行动:尖峰战士) and Splinter Cell: Double Agent(细胞分裂:双重间谍). During that period I got myself familiar with **Unreal Tech**, gained some practical experiences about **XBox and XBox 360**, and became friends with a number of talented people who are actively gearing up the game industry in Shanghai. 

In 2007, I went to **Goldcool Games**(金酷游戏) which was later acquired by Shanda(盛大网络). A 3D MMO title named **Magic World 2**(魔界2) was kicked off after my arriving. I evaluated several engines (with Gamebryo chosen), picked up developers for this project, and mainly focused on developing it for around 3 years. I became Gamebryo-capable and had quite a lot of components designed and implemented during that time. The product was presented at GDC 2010 Expo, which was a fine journey to me in SF.

In December of 2010, I co-founded **U Know Games**(游诺网络) and led the development of a typical MMO title for nearly two years. Beside the management role, I also participated in designing and implementing some main constructs: the underlying **data-driven scripting model**, **byte-stream-and-replication-based networking model**, **frontend tool-chain**, **integrated all-in-one editor**, and some other smaller components. However, with an unprecedented hardwork with the whole team, unfortunately we still failed to achieve our goal on time. It became a sad story that our investor ZQGames(中青宝) asked us to transform the MMO into a web game. While most of our developers resisted to this transformation, the project **ended up being terminated** in the autumn of 2012.

Before moving to Zhuhai in 2014, I spent one and a half year working at **CCP Games (Shanghai)**, with main focus on helping to improve the toolchain of Dust 514, which was launched in May 2013. In the spring of 2014 my family made a decision to leave Shanghai for a whole new adventure in southern China. Currently I'm working at **Seasun Games(西山居)** as a technical manager. 

Although in half of my career I have been some kind of managers, project leads and that sort of roles, I still recognize myself as a programmer, who constantly **believes in simplicity** when designing and coding, and takes the programming as **a combination of gardening art and architectural engineering**.

I'm currently working on some Unity-based mobile titles mainly, and a few VR prototypes in spare time.
